Employee Attrition Prediction
Nowadays, firms are expanding at a tremendous rate, and with this mass expansion, experienced professionals are in high demand by the companies. An experienced employee is like an asset to the company; upon losing, companies either try to retain the employee with a revised compensation, or they can always hire a new employee. However, predicting this can save a lot of money and time. Additionally, it will allow the company's management to control a project pipeline efficiently, enabling them to manage the hiring and existing workforce flexibly.
